# Phase-3

## Evaluation -> Need Finding

The designs in the previous iterations has help us to explore new features that we can add in our final design so that our targeted audience can get most of it. For this final design we will make sure that the every user can enjoy our application while using it for that we have made our design simple and have allowed ease of control, discoverability and affordance.

## Design Alternatives

### Personas

1.Ann is a personal secretory of Mr. Alex. As a secretory she has lots of tasks to perform every now and then and schedule all the tasks and meeting for Mr. Alex. She should always be prepared in advance to cope up with the speed of her boss. Mr. Alex wants his work perfect and there is no margin of any kind of delay and error. Ann now has to be active and fast enough to help Mr. Alex in his work. If she could manage to create a list of important appointments and schedule that will help her so much.

2.Sam is a student in XYZ University. He is the eldest in his family and likes socializing with his family, friends. He immerse himself in variety of academic and cultural activities as well. Most of the time he forgets his schedules and tasks that he prepared for himself regarding every aspects. So needs something that inform him ahead of time about his daily schedule so that he can feel free and give his best for every activity he perform.

## Scenarios

1.Joe works in the shipping department of a large company, where he is responsible for the pickup and delivery of about 200 packages a day across 10 buildings. To maintain his aggressive schedule, he is always on the move, either with a cart or carrying a few packages underarm but he usually can’t manage all the schedule because he do not know how to manage them. Between deliveries, Joe occasionally needs to access his mobile phone. So he decided to download sn scheduling app and then he find out how his managing gets better and delivering becomes on time.

2.Bilal is a business man and a only father. He use to invest in many other companies as well he has to do a lot of work and meetings as well as he have to visits places and along this he has to give time to their children in this busy schedule he usually forget many of his places to visit which are importing for him. Than he decide to write down his schedule on paper after that he faces many problem as he have to write daily about his schedule or if he writes about his monthly schedule than he has problem in searching that which task he has to do now and he has faces many more problem after that he decided to download sn app so that he can once schedule it and then can easily search as well as he don’t have to check it again and again as it notifies on time. After that his all problem became less.

## Using Hci Concept,The Reason For Key Design Features In Our Interface

We have worked and finalized our design on Task “Schedule” as many people now a days are busy with different sort of things and wants that all of their tasks to be accomplished rapidly. Our designed application design helps the user in this aspect. Affordance is used for this design, as the user can easily detect what he could do or perform with certain option. It is simple design with options that can help people achieve their tasks easily and help managing their daily needs and schedules. Rather than placing everything on one page we have allowed discoverability, such that user can perform tasks and explore different options and functions one can perform on this app. We have provided different forms of views for user for their schedules with remainder for each tasks, Flexibility.  
The features of our finalized design are:

### Scheduler
It consist of two options for the users mapping of functions is main concern over here as user are been provided 2 tasks options that are the user can view all the scheduled tasks that are completed or not or those tasks that he wants to perform ahead. Each scheduled task can be edited if user want to edit it and delete the task. This function follows the concept of tolerance, once the user has made a scheduled task he can simply edit it. We have place a room for Flexibility for the user if the user may or may not want to have a note regarding the task its up to the users.
The second option contains chart for each scheduled task with proper timing and week planning I.e. which task is on which day and what time is allocated for that certain task.
This design focuses on robustness, user can achieve his tasks. The main idea behind these different options is that sometimes when the user is in hurry he wants that he can have a look on his tasks or have a look on what time he is available he can simply select either of these options and look accordingly. This things make the app function visible for users, Visibility

### Calendar

It consist of two options for the users mapping of functions is main concern over here as user are been provided 2 tasks options that are the user can view all the activities marked on the calender along with the current date mentioned on the calendar these activities date are marked different so that the user can easily have a look on all of their tasks, flexibility. This interface also helps the user to find what task is placed against that date simply by clicking on that date. Detailed note for task can be seen by the user and can be edited.
The second option contains week sheet where user can see their tasks against the each week day and the activities will be marked on this week schedule so that user can easily have a quick look over his activities, perceptibility.

### Add Task

Here the user can add new task for his schedule. He can also set date and time for each task and for reminder the user is also provided with alarm option where user can set an alarm to notify the user for the task ahead of time, user can easily review his newly added tasks, flexibility. This will help the user to have foresight for his upcoming tasks. Detailed note for the new task can be seen by the user once the user presses done button, ease of use.

This design is implemented to reduce load upon one shoulder and help in scheduling the activities, this focuses on robustness, and user can achieve his tasks.These option can easily be used and explored by the user with no error conditions. User can freely perform his tasks. We have made our design simple and have allowed ease of control for users, discoverablility and affordance
