# Phase-3

## Evaluation -> Need Finding

The designs in the previous iterations has help us to explore new features that we can add in our final design so that our targeted audience can get most of it. For this final design we will make sure that the every user can enjoy our application while using it for that we have made our design simple and have allowed ease of control, discoverability and affordance.

2.Sam is a student in XYZ University. He is the eldest in his family and likes socializing with his family, friends. He immerse himself in variety of academic and cultural activities as well. Most of the time he forgets his schedules and tasks that he prepared for himself regarding every aspects. So needs something that inform him ahead of time about his daily schedule so that he can feel free and give his best for every activity he perform.

## Scenarios

To maintain his aggressive schedule, he is always on the move, either with a cart or carrying a few packages underarm but he usually canâ€™t manage all the schedule because he do not know how to manage them. Between deliveries, Joe occasionally needs to access his mobile phone. So he decided to download sn scheduling app and then he find out how his managing gets better and delivering becomes on time.

## Using Hci Concept,The Reason For Key Design Features In Our Interface

### Calendar

It consist of two options for the users mapping of functions is main concern over here as user are been provided 2 tasks options that are the user can view all the activities marked on the calender along with the current date mentioned on the calendar these activities date are marked different so that the user can easily have a look on all of their tasks, flexibility. This interface also helps the user to find what task is placed against that date simply by clicking on that date. Detailed note for task can be seen by the user and can be edited.
The second option contains week sheet where user can see their tasks against the each week day and the activities will be marked on this week schedule so that user can easily have a quick look over his activities, perceptibility.

### Add Task

Here the user can add new task for his schedule. He can also set date and time for each task and for reminder the user is also provided with alarm option where user can set an alarm to notify the user for the task ahead of time, user can easily review his newly added tasks, flexibility. This will help the user to have foresight for his upcoming tasks. Detailed note for the new task can be seen by the user once the user presses done button, ease of use.

This design is implemented to reduce load upon one shoulder and help in scheduling the activities, this focuses on robustness, and user can achieve his tasks.
